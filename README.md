# BioBots
A website for my robotics team, BioBots. My FTC team is dedicated towards solving problems in the real-world such as a lack of students around the world who cannot receive access to robotic supplies. We have an outreach program which is dedicated to solving this issue. We also compete in tournaments for the First Tech Challenge.
